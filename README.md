# promptinjection.wtf

A resource for understanding prompt injection and why it matters.

## About

Prompt injection is when AI systems can be tricked into ignoring their instructions. It's a fundamental security flaw that every major AI system currently has, and there's no clear fix.

This site aims to:
1. Explain the problem in plain English
2. Track news and developments
3. Eventually: Build demonstrations that make the danger visceral
